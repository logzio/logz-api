Logz.io alerts use a Kibana search query to continuously scan your logs and alert you when a certain set of conditions is met. The simplest alerts can use a simple search query or a particular filter, but others can be quite complex and involve several conditions with varying thresholds.

When alerts trigger, they write event logs. Event logs of triggered alerts are always available and searchable in Kibana - just filter for `_exists_:logzio-alert`. But you also have the option to add notifications, and control their contents, format, and who they are sent to.

For the deprecated alerting version, please see our [public GitHub project](https://github.com/logzio/public-api/tree/master/alerts).
