Use these API requests to manage time-based log accounts:
* Create, update, or delete a sub account.
* Allocate daily capacity to the main account and/or sub accounts.
* Retrieve account activity stats and/or account configuration details.

### Flexible storage & shared volume
  
Flexible storage and shared volume allow accounts to share indexing capacity.

To enable shared volume, go to the [Manage accounts page](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) in the Logz.io app and toggle the button **Use flexible volume** to turn it on.

To determine whether flexible storage is enabled, run a `Get` request to retrieve account details.
* If `isFlexible` is true, flexible storage is enabled and every account has reserved capacity set by the parameter `reservedDailyGB`.
* If false, flexible storage is disabled and the parameter `reservedDailyGB` is null.
