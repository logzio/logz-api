You can archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage. Archiving gives you the option to restore logs and query them after they have expired from your time-based account.

You can use the following endpoints to retrieve, set up, test, and update an account's archive settings.

Note: Logs are archived before they are indexed and analyzed by Logz.io. If you are using drop filters, note that dropped logs will still be archived.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
