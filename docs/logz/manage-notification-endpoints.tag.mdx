Logz.io can send notifications to your preferred workspaces, such as Opsgenie, BigPanda, PagerDuty, and Slack.

Notifications are typically sent when alerts are triggered, when a user shares a Kibana object, or when Logz.io Insights identifies new exceptions in your logs.

Use these API endpoints to create, update, or delete notification endpoints. If you configure a custom endpoint, you can configure the notification message body. Otherwise, you can use any of the available preconfigured endpoints.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
