You can restore data from your active archiving account, whether an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage. Restoring data gives you the option to query logs after they have expired from your time-based account.

You can use the following endpoints to initiate a new restore process, retrieve, set up, test, and update an account's archive settings.

Note: Logs that are dropped by drop filters are still archived and can be restored. You can temporarily disable drop filters to restore the data.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
