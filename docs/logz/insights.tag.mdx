Logz.io monitors your logs for Insights to help you preempt issues and alert you of potential problems.

There are two types of Insights:
* LOGCEPTION - Application errors and exceptions identified in the stack trace.
* PUBLIC_CI - Cognitive Insights correlate your logs with  vulnerabilities and issues that are trending in the open source community.

You have the option to set up an alert so you can get notified of the details when new or recurring insights are spotted in your system.

**Note:** This endpoint requires permissions that must be set by our Support team. Please email [help@logz.io](mailto:help@logz.io) for assistance.
