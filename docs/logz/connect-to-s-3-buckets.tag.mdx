Establish a connection for the Logz.io fetcher to fetch logs to the Logz.io observability platform via an S3 bucket. Supports ELB, S3 Access, CloudFront, VPC Flow logs.

If you're looking to fetch CloudTrail logs, use the designated endpoints.

Authentication can be established with either S3 secret credentials or ARNs (for AWS IAM Roles). Authentication with S3 Secret Credentials is supported for backward compatibility. Authentication with ARNs (for IAM Roles) is strongly recommended.
